After I returned at about 4:30, I checked the nest, and he had left.There was an adult male within 100 yards east of the nest and two younger kestrels within 200 yards east of the nest, so I am sure they will have lots of company.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nI just came back from a drive while checking on the kestrels.This afternoon on the power lines on Rohret by the hay field where there was one adult and two young kestrels.Tonight there are now one adult and 4 young kestrels.I think this may be working out.

and paperwork filed. Medical These two males were a lot different than the female we released earlier.The female jumped up to the hole and was gone in 2 minutes.This time, the first male jumped up to the hole after 5 minutes.And spent another 20 minutes sitting there until he took off.I waited until an hour, and the other male did not appear.I had a commitment that I needed to attend, and he had not appeared at the hole yet. After I returned at about 4:30, I checked the nest, and he had left.There was an adult male within 100 yards east of the nest and two younger kestrels within 200 yards east of the nest, so I am sure they will have lots of company.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nI just came back from a drive while checking on the kestrels.This afternoon on the power lines on Rohret by the hay field where there was one adult and two young kestrels.Tonight there are now one adult and 4 young kestrels.I think this may be working out.

Two messages from Tuesday night on an AMCR found at a Casey's in downtown Iowa City. UI student Olivia picked it up and put it in a box. I was on my way to get it from her Wednesday AM, she called and told me she looked in the box and it had passed.&nbsp;
Davenport, caller reported a bird of prey standing for a long time not moving in a yard. I returned the call and he told me it had flown off.

Randy noticed an injured hawk on the I-80 E Dubuque exit (had to swerve to avoid it while he was exiting). He left a VM with the location. Molly went to check it out about an hour later but could not find it.
Buck captured an injured hawk in his backyard in IC. Molly will pick up on the way to clinic today. (new admit 25135 above)
GHOW with suspected wing injury in Wheatland IA was captured and put in a box. Left VM asking them to call us back for transport instructions. Barb called back a little before 5 - she can’t drive over tonight but she thinks she can transport tomorrow morning. Sent her contact information to Amanda to coordinate a time.

VM from someone who was upset that we weren’t answering/didn’t regularly check FB messages. It seems they were calling about an owl but there was no specific information given. Did not answer my call so I left a VM asking them to contact me if they need help with an injured bird. Also explained that we are volunteer based and are not always at the clinic, but that we do check the phones regularly every day.

Cedar Rapids - bird on ground trying to fly.&nbsp; By the time I called back they had called animal control.&nbsp; No idea what kind of bird it was.
I forgot to check the phones at 5, checked at 7:30 and called.&nbsp; She called from CR, Hwy 13 area&nbsp; about an injured Osprey in her hay field.&nbsp; She got a box and went back and could not find it.&nbsp; When I talked to her at 7:30 she went back out to look for it, still could not locate.&nbsp; She will look for again tomorrow and call my cell number.

Melody from West Liberty called about RTHA in backyard that isn’t flying. She captured and will bring to clinic.
Brad from ACT campus called about GHOW on the ground. They do not feel comfortable capturing. Elana went to capture and brought to clinic (new admit above).
Elizabeth from Poweshiek County found an injured gray catbird in her yard while mowing. Referred her to IBR.
Call about a duck near the Coralville dam with a hook in its beak. The caller said it was too fast for them to capture, but that they had also notified the DNR and just wanted to let us know. Sent a text with info for Blackhawk and Wildlife, just in case anything changed and they were able to capture.
Jeremy from Dubuque County Conservation has a juvenile BAEA that was pulled out of a stream. He thinks he can get someone to transport the bird to us, so I gave Elana his info to coordinate tomorrow.

Medical These two males were a lot different than the female we released earlier.The female jumped up to the hole and was gone in 2 minutes.This time, the first male jumped up to the hole after 5 minutes.And spent another 20 minutes sitting there until he took off.I waited until an hour, and the other male did not appear.I had a commitment that I needed to attend, and he had not appeared at the hole yet. After I returned at about 4:30, I checked the nest, and he had left.There was an adult male within 100 yards east of the nest and two younger kestrels within 200 yards east of the nest, so I am sure they will have lots of company.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I just came back from a drive while checking on the kestrels.This afternoon on the power lines on Rohret by the hay field where there was one adult and two young kestrels.Tonight there are now one adult and 4 young kestrels.I think this may be working out.

Baby bunnies in IC. Referred to Suzanne.
Baby birds in CR. Referred to Dr. Jana.
Andy with On the Run Pet Rescue was contacted by residents about BAEA seen on the ground for a few days (able to run but not fly). He captured and transported to clinic. Put in cage on a perch (able to perch). Will need full exam tomorrow. Scott County Conservation called about eagle above to confirm we got it. Left VM confirming we did. Wood duck found at construction site in IC. Referred to Dr Jana.
Julie in IC found hawk on the corner of Court St and Westminster St next to another dead hawk. Based on picture it’s a fledgling COHA. She and I both went back to the area to find it and did not see it anymore.
Kiara in Davenport found a baby squirrel after a storm. Referred to two rehabbers in Clinton County.
Jill in Guthrie Center has owl in a ditch at her house (it was hard to tell from the VM but I think she said a tree was cut down?) and she did not feel comfortable capturing it. Left her a VM with the number for SOAR since they're about 30min away.
Becca in Fairfield called about a BDOW that she and a friend found a couple days ago with a wing injury. They tried to take it to a center at Oakland Mills but they don’t do rehab. The BDOW was with her friend in Mt Pleasant, so Kathy went to get the bird today and will bring to clinic tomorrow (thank you, Kathy!!).

On 6/15 we received a call about a possum that was then picked up by animal control. Guy called back and to see how it was doing. I told him that since it did not come into our care, we do not know. Referred him to Iowa City Animal Control.
Two calls about baby birds falling out of their nest. One in Iowa City and another in Linn Co. Both referred to Dr. Jana. got in touch with one and left a voicemail to the other.

Injured eagle in Marion, called and left a message but haven't heard back yet.&nbsp;
Baby bunnies, referred.&nbsp;
Matt from Waterloo, called yesterday evening about a RTHA hopping on the ground, but wasn't sure if it was injured (he saw no visible injury) or just a fledgling, and wanted the number to a local rehabber. I called back and left a message, said it could be learning how to fly but if it started showing signs of distress he could call Blackhawk and gave him the number.&nbsp; He called me back and left a nasty voicemail. Said he worked on the Osprey project and he knew what he was doing (this confused me because I never said he didn't), told me I needed to work on my terminology, because I said bouncing around instead of hopping around in my message, and then proceeded to list everything wrong with the bird and how Terese was going to nurse it back to health, as if I was refusing to help the bird directly when he requested a rehabber in his area. I have since blocked his number on my phone for my own peace of mind.

Call last night about an RTHA in Davenport not flying in someone’s yard. Called back this morning - it had flown away a couple hours later. Sounded like a younger bird based on description.
RTHA on ground in park in Davenport. Received a video and confirmed it’s a fledgling. Standing upright with no apparent injuries. Instructed caller to let us know if she sees it again lying prone or appearing to be injured.
Bat box fell with bats inside - referred to Wild Thunder.
Songbird in Eagle Point Park in Clinton IA. Looked like a fledgling that was fine, but gave them other contacts if needed.

Baby sparrow, called left message, no return call.&nbsp;
Night Hawk, Quad Cities - thought was injured, hopped/ran away dragging wing.&nbsp; Continued to go back to the same spot. To me it sounded like it was trying to lure him away from the nest.&nbsp; He was going to check out the next time he was at the plant.&nbsp;
BJ - From IC, Scott Blvd.&nbsp; Observed a hawk on her fence for 4 hours, with another one visiting.&nbsp; She sent a photo, young bird.&nbsp; Alert and perching.&nbsp; I asked her to keep an eye on him and let us know if he appears lethargic or is laying down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Call from last night about baby birds in CR. Based on VM, it sounded like songbirds, so left a VM with Dr Jana’s number but told them to call back if they weren’t sure or if that wasn’t the case.
Call about nighthawk in DeWitt - kept flying down to sit in parking lot, but then flies away when approached. Not apparent injuries. Advised caller to keep an eye out for a possible nest on the ground, and if so, try to rope off so it’s not disturbed. Gave caller Dr Jana’s number in case anything changes and the bird appears to be injured.

He claims that they pecked a hole in his roof and now his home is leaking. Wants us to come and capture them or he was going to shoot them. Tried to explain and reason with him but he would not listen. Sonja called him and others have been notified including DNR. If he calls back making demands, notify Sonja.

5:27 pm - 319-359-0807 Alana - Baby rabbits. Called back and since the voicemail was full sent a text. Waiting to receive information as to where they are so I can properly refer them.
9:20 pm - Mic Preston IA RTHA in backyard. Injured. Can't put in box. 563-206-4827. Called back. Seems like a juvenile RTHA who is hanging out on the farm. Assured them that they can observe for now.
Goose caught in netting in Scott County. Referred. Noticed we don’t have Scott County in the IA DNR Rehab list. The caller gave the contact info of who they got in touch with: Brooks VanDerBeek (563-349-8953). Should we add him to the contact list?

Injured robin in Bettendorf. Referred.&nbsp;
Crazy lady from North Liberty. Called about a vulture, we think a TUVU. The bird was flying around and shaking its head. It seems like it was preening and getting gnats off of it. However, the caller was sure it had rabies and was going to come for her kids and pets. Though we told her that vultures can’t get rabies since they digest it and only eat dead things, the caller threatened to shoot the bird. Sonja went out and checked out the address to protect the bird from this caller. But, she could not find it.&nbsp;
Displaced songbirds in Red Oak, IA. Referred to Iowa Bid Rehab in Des Moines.

Iowa City, 560th Street, off Sand Road, Finder thought they came across an injured hawk in the ditch with another hawk circling overhead. Jeanine checked out and couldn’t locate the bird but did see a hawk flying in the area. Sounds like it could have been a fledgling and parent. Finder didn’t get a pic.
Davenport, injured crow. Gave them Dr. Jana info for them to text her pic and info.
Bettendorf, injured mourning dove or pigeon. Gave them Dr. Janas info for them to text her pic and info.
Iowa City, another call on the BDOW baby at Performing Arts building. Was placed in tree this morning where it stayed most of the day but it’s on the ground again.
Bertram, hawk on ground most of day, doesn’t fly when approached. Sent pic which I shared with Sonja. Fledgling, looks healthy.

Bird flew into warehouse in IC and got stuck in glue trap. It ended up being a house sparrow, but I popped over after clinic and helped remove it with dish soap and water.
Two calls about the same baby barred owls in Marion. The home owner called first because they had fallen out of their tree in the front yard and were getting attacked by crows. Their friend came over to put them in a box, and then called us to see if we needed to admit them. I met the friend at her house. The owlets had some gnat bites around the eyes but no other injuries. We took them back to the finder’s house, doused them with bug soother, and put them back in the original tree. While we were chatting, one of the parents flew into a neighbor’s tree to watch. Very cool!

Iowa City, baby bunny, cat had brought home. Referred.
Iowa City, Deceased BDOW found under utility pole. I went by on my way to clinic and picked it up. It appeared to have struck the power lines/pole and likely died of&nbsp; head trauma. Blood coming out of the oral cavity and eye damage. Utility pole was a junction of several lines and electrical equipment. It still had its prey clutched in talons, a baby bunny. I took it to clinic, labeled it and put it in the freezer for proper disposal.
Davenport, baby bird, couldn’t locate nest. Referred to Dr. Jana. Finder willing to transport today.

Williamsburg, lady had seen what she thought was a mature screech owl in her pine tree.&nbsp; She was concerned because she had seen it perched in the same spot for the last 2 days. She didn’t think it was injured. I told her to just keep an eye on it and call back if needed.&nbsp; She asked for Luke when I answered the phone. Didn’t give me her name.

Rock Island, BAEA HBC on Hwy 92. Her husband had spotted and called her to find help. When I called her back she was enroute to the eagle. Several people were pulled over. It appeared the BAEA was going for a roadkill hawk when it was hit. BAEA was deceased when she arrived. She told me someone had contacted USFW and they were coming to pick it up. I asked her to toss the roadkill hawk far from the highway.
Davenport, Guy that works for a gutter company, had baby squirrels in a box that were displaced, referred.

Release notes: Picked up and drove to Crawfordsville where we met with the finder and his family for the release.&nbsp; 107 had other ideas, she had gotten one side of the box open and as I was removing the box from my car she decided that she was going NOW!&nbsp; She flew about 10 feet and then sat &amp; watched us.&nbsp; It took her a bit to get herself oriented before she took off and flew across the field. volunteers-
Finder in Davis County had a snow junco for a week, and its entire wing fell off but was somehow not bleeding and lively.&nbsp; Dr. Jana said put it outside.&nbsp; Asked World Bird Sanctuary, Niabi Zoo, &amp; Tracy if they wanted an educational bird.&nbsp; Still trying to find a place for it to be euthanized.&nbsp; Injured squirrel in JC - referred to Suzanne Hoofnagle.&nbsp;&nbsp;
4 pm Hawk (photos below) with 1 wing that was bent at crooked angle (not sure if there is an eye injury or just glare in photo) on southbound side of hwy.&nbsp; Start looking at the intersection of US 218 &amp; 192nd St. in the L southbound lane and get into the L lane.&nbsp; He was 8-10 ft into the median.&nbsp; If you get to the highway patrol turnaround, you’ve gone too far.&nbsp; Barb Davis &amp; her husband, (319) 209-1528, can be called with questions.&nbsp; They tried to catch it but couldn’t and had dogs in their car.&nbsp; They live in Burlington, so won’t be going back that way.&nbsp; Jeanine or Kathy will look for him tomorrow.

Mike Murphy’s daughter found an EASO last night on the side of the road near their house at 1820 315th St. Brighton, IA 52540.&nbsp; It did fly up about 6 ft, but that was all.&nbsp; They thought it might just be cold and wet, so they put it in a box overnight.&nbsp; This morning, they opened the box, and it still didn’t fly away.&nbsp; There is a balcony on the 2nd floor of his house and a 2 car garage.&nbsp; Zach Rosnith of Washington Co Conservation is bringing it to clinic tomorrow.

Cedar Rapids, Rockwell Collins, 2 calls on an adult RTHA that was sitting on top of a bike rack by an entrance that wasn’t moving. They thought it was injured and called the DNR. DNR told them it was probably bird flu and if they wanted they could call us. I talked her into approaching it to see if it could fly. It flew off fine and landed on a nearby rooftop.
Cedar Rapids, caller had hit a BDOW last night, deceased. He wanted to know if he needed to get it to us or how to dispose of it. He told me he appreciated the work we do and is sending us a check donation.
Rural Iowa City, caller was observing several BAEAs feasting on an animal in a field. He thought a juvenile couldn’t fly. When I returned the call he told me that he had seen it fly off.

Rose from Riverside called regarding an eagle that was on the East bank of the Iowa River.&nbsp; She lived on the West Bank.&nbsp; I googled the address to see what was on the East bank… Farm field, no through road.&nbsp; I called the DNR and Washington County Conservation.&nbsp; Washington County went out, put eyes on the bird.&nbsp; He was walking around, doing some hop flying, but never getting airborne.&nbsp; The ice wasn’t safe and Zack (WCC) indicated that there were potentially several property owners that they would need to track down in order to get permission to go in..&nbsp;&nbsp;
Caller from Bettendorf called about a Coyote with mange that was outside her business.&nbsp; Referred to DNR or Scott County Conservation.

As of 3 PM will check again. Nighthawk down in Iowa City for several days. Refer to Dr Jana. We received messages from 2 other people.&nbsp; One call was regarding frozen quail for sale at a discount which I referred to Sonja.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We got 3 other messages from the same person about an injured owl.&nbsp; I (Connie) called her several times always getting a recording saying that the person I was calling was not taking calls.&nbsp; I let Kathy know what was going on and she suggested I text her and ask her to call my number which I did.&nbsp; In her final message she left her email address.&nbsp; I sent her an email message and gave her my number and asked her to call me so that we could figure out a way to get the bird to the clinic.&nbsp; As of now 5:48pm,&nbsp; I have not heard back from her.
7pm - Made another attempt to call person who left messages regarding the injured owl and still getting the same recording that the person is not accepting calls

Call from UI campus about a hawk with a foot injury; bird was confirmed flight capable and was in a tree sitting with one leg pulled up into its feathers. I called the finder back and left a message to see if the bird was still around (2 hours after he left the message) and I never heard back. Dawn let me know there was a Facebook post about it so hopefully someone can keep an eye on it.&nbsp;

Burlington, Evan Smith (319-850-1330) Juvenile RTHA got into their chicken coop last evening. It killed and ate a chicken and scuffled with roosters. When she got it out of there to release it, it couldn’t fly. She kept it in a kennel overnight and it was in worse condition this morning. Amanda picked it up today and will bring it to the clinic tomorrow.

Many calls about baby birds.&nbsp; Most were able to be renested, did give Dr Jana’s number to several.
One call from a Dubuque golf course employee with a young hawk on the grounds.&nbsp; We discussed the baby, based on his observations the baby did not sound like he was distressed.&nbsp; He will send me a photo on Saturday.

Message from midnight last night about owl on melrose ave near interstate. I investigated on my way from barn to clinic and could not find it.
HY COHA in Iowa City. Advised how to make a makeshift nest.
Bird nest fell down in Davenport. 1 survivor. Advised to re-attach nest to tree or call Dr Jana.
HY AMKE in Maquoketa. Advised to look for nest and put back, otherwise she is able to bring it to clinic tomorrow if she cannot locate the nest. I will coordinate with Dawn/Halie if it needs to come in. She has had it since friday and has been feeding it ground beef. Advised not to feed it anything else, and that ground beef is not a proper diet for a AMKE.
Call from Davenport company that wants an active bird nest removed. Advised almost all nesting birds are federally protected and nests cannot be removed while active. Referred to Scott Co DNR for more info.
Please make sure to erase voicemails on the days you are scheduled. There were 3 old voicemails from Fri and Sat on the machine. If the call is unresolved, take down the info, erase the message, and relay the info to whomever needs it.

We refilled the isofluorine. Unfortunately: despite heroic efforts by Jodeane, sink still leaks. Some cross-thread issues and 4 one-mL syringes found in J-bend of sink. (We shut off water and took sink apart, we’re surprised to find the syringes. Check sink carefully and use that mesh screen in drain.)

Baby GHOW on the ground that caller was on way to pick up when she left VM. I called her back, she did not answer, so I left her a voicemail telling her if it's not injured to leave it alone or put in makeshift nest. Did not hear back from her.
Large eggs (bigger than chicken) found under porch. Caller said she has not seen any ducks/geese in the area. I told her to observe for a few days to be sure she's not disturbing an active nest, but that it may just be a stockpile that a raccoon or similar animal has stored there after raiding a nest.

There will not be birds in the corn crib until Sunday. No need to trek through the snow down there! Bano is the only non-barn bird that needs cared for.
I did not clean or collect pellets, as the snow was already coming down pretty hard and I wanted to make sure I could get out of the driveway, and that Denali and Asio had a safe trip back with me. Lane was driveable in my Honda accord, but be cautious with the new snow falling tonight. All locks worked while I was there.

IC, Finder was concerned about an owl that had been seen around the Fieldhouse for the last few days. I checked it out.&nbsp; It’s a mature BDOW that was in the trees in front by the entrance.&nbsp; It flew several times between trees while I was there and also went after two crows that were harassing it.&nbsp; I called the finder back and told him it appeared fine and was acting normal.
IC, report of an injured goose by UIHC.&nbsp; I called back several times, no answer and her voice mail was not set up to leave a message.
Two calls on injured baby rabbits. One was from Walcott and the other was a local construction site that had destroyed the nest. Referred.
Jacob Wilbourne, Cedar County Conservation about BDOW at barn.&nbsp; He talked with Sonja and they’ve made arrangements for Friday.

All birds fed and watered. Spent more time today raking cages and scraping some areas of accumulated waste. Especially in the BDOW cage. Pellet jars knocked off shelf behind freezer. I suspect a raccoon as I also removed raccoon waste near steps. I removed trash.&nbsp;
All other birds ate all food from Saturday.

Sam from USDA Wildlife Services Cargill in Eddyville, he had an injured GHOW at their work place that he said was in rough shape. I called back, no answer. Left him the number of Jodi Rigler (next county over) to see if she could assist. Also gave him IBRs info as they’re a bit closer than we are.
Coralville, Finder had a homing pigeon that had wandered on to their jobsite. It was visibly injured with a gash on its wing and chest.&nbsp; He wrapped it up and kept it in his truck today and somehow found Suzanne Hoofnagles contact info after he left a message with us. Suzanne knew of a vet in CR that has experience with these birds and referred him there. Finder was taking it to the CR vet after work and she will care for and notify the bird's owner after obtaining info from its band.&nbsp; He told me the band had identifying numbers and “Chicago” on it.&nbsp; So interesting!&nbsp; Dawn: Dr. Jana (Iowa City) will treat pigeons.&nbsp; Amber Oldfield (Coggon in Linn County) did but had problems with her housing, and I don’t know if those are resolved.

Music was obnoxious but got quiet by the time I left.&nbsp; Glad the decibel meter is in place.
At this time we are no longer in need of blankets, towels, small cleaning towels, scrubs or Pet taxis. If someone brings a bird in a pet taxi please remove bird and give the pet taxi back to the finder. We have cardboard pet taxis located by Anesthesia machine. I would prefer you use those for you to transport to and from injury site or to and from barn/clinic. If sending a bird to release please use boxes on top of cage. They are free the others cost RARE money. Please don’t let boxes build up at barn. Recycle or bring back to clinic. Some are needed at barn for transport purposes. We have installed a decibel monitor at 29A to track noise. Please do not move. You are all doing a fabulous job keeping the birds healthy and safe. Please know you are all appreciated. We also have bird seed available again.
Colin, have you got anything in the works for giving Tuesday? Also please contact KathyJanz about some ideas for fundraising she has. Please update our wants and needs on the website/FB. Anyone think of anything?

Wonder what the red marking on the wall in River Barn cage were from? Have to ask Jodeane sometime. Also noted a dirt on east wall of TUVU cage. Don't know if that is something either.
Lastly, unplugged the heater per Sonja and provided her with a food inventory from barn. Beautiful day. Got to watch a red headed woodpecker and gray squirrel scolding each other in a cedar tree near the barn.

I brought my handheld vacuum in. It is on the desk near the front door, and works nicely to clean up killy’s turf if it isn't caked in fresh poop. Feel free to use it for whatever while it’s here. I’ll take it home eventually. I bet it works great for rogue feathers!
Took 2 bags of deluxe cardinal blend, and 1 bag of black oil sunflower seeds. $75 check from nahant marsh left on the clip on the desk by the front door, and $40 paid by me via the “donate” feature on our website.
Still had music next door almost the entire time I was at clinic. Not too loud, but I could hear it.
Multi column
Notice Please keep a close eye on him for flat flies. There were a couple in the “office” area while I was there. Medical Put some folded newspaper underneath his flat wood perch, so hopefully his nice new turf doesn't get poopy too fast.
Propped up his big stick slightly, and added a couple perches so he can maneuver around the cage nicely. Scrubbed poop off current turf, hung it up to dry, and added the other black turf that was there. Window time.
He seemed to enjoy the new perches, and I saw him on all but one of the perches while I was at clinic. Multi column

The music and bass beats were very loud at 11:15 am, and there was a young adult white man outside of the gym that saw us go into the clinic.&nbsp; I assume he was a customer.&nbsp; It got quieter around maybe 12:15 pm and stayed at that same volume till about 2:30 pm.&nbsp; If they could turn the bass down lower than the rest of the music, it would have been a fairly acceptable level, but they probably can’t.&nbsp; I worry about the birds, especially Killy, if he is hearing that bass all day and all night.
Susan Jaecques bought a bag of cardinal bird seed and left the money on the board with the Oct. schedule on it.&nbsp; I hope that’s ok.&nbsp; She also took home the low half log perch with black carpet to make it less wobbly.

Music is still VERY loud from the new gym next door. I could clearly hear all lyrics and feel the bass to every song played. There was one car parked in our 3rd spot when I arrived, and a different car parked there when I left. If the parking issue persists, I suggest we get a sign that warns that unauthorized parking will lead to towing at owner's expense - if our building will allow it. Nahant Marsh gets signs made from “Iowa prison industries” and they are relatively inexpensive, and good quality.

Edie Thomas - Stuart Ct&nbsp; IC - called about a COHA on her porch with an injured leg.&nbsp; Called her and asked if she was able to contain it until I was able to get there after work.&nbsp; She didn’t want to try to catch it because she just had surgery and didn’t want to get an infection handling the bird.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Denise called me and said that IC animal control had called her to update her on the COHA from yesterday and report that they had picked up an injured RTHA from the 1st ave area.&nbsp; We determined that this was the same bird in the calls above.&nbsp; (Margaret called back to report that the bird was gone).&nbsp; Denise went to pick up - the birds R leg was barely attached.&nbsp; Animal Control euthanized.
The COHA that escaped from animal control yesterday is still in the salt barn.&nbsp; An employee from the streets department called Denise, he will try to catch the hawk tomorrow.

IC, Blank &amp; McCune, 1 block off Burlington on the corner of Van Buren and College. Christina 319-325-8785 reported a hawk that had been grounded in their parking lot today, when approached she said it only hopped and couldn’t fly. I went in and found it sitting in front of a car, it flew off when I was within about 6 feet of it. It flew across the street, across a creek and landed on top of a chain link fence. It can fly but doesn't get much height. Looked like a SSHA. I told them to keep an eye out for it. Wonder if there was any connection to call yesterday as it appears to be in the same vicinity.
UPDATE - IC Animal Control picked up what they think was an injured COHA by the police department. As she was unloading it to take into the shelter it flew off and landed nearby an open barn/salt pile at the streets department. She notified the workers and will check tomorrow to see if it’s still in the vicinity.&nbsp; Mara 319-936-4828
IC - Margaret McGinnis 508-404-8586, 616 N. 1st Avenue, She thinks injured RTHA in her backyard. Observed eating a rabbit but she thought its wing didn’t look right and it may be limping. I told her to call the RARE number back tomorrow morning if it was still there.

There are styrofoam boxes that food comes in.&nbsp; I have the address (839 S 1st Ave, IC: Sellers &amp; Seekers Real Estate) on the boxes of a company that will accept them to use for feral cat homes.&nbsp; If anyone has time could they please drop off.&nbsp; This building has an entryway that can be opened, and the boxes can be left in there even if no one is there.

Be careful to move wood blocks that secure cage doors so they can’t fall back in place and trap you in back cages.&nbsp; I was careless about that today and got locked in.&nbsp;I was lucky that my husband came along today and was waiting in the car.&nbsp; I managed to get his attention, but the Ransom cage was secured shut from the inside.&nbsp;He was able to lift the hook and walk through to let me out of the back cage.&nbsp;It would have been an unpleasantly hot wait in the cage to get someone else’s attention if it had come to that!

Please remember to keep an eye on the food and question it if you think its getting low..&nbsp; Lets just say it will take at least a week to get it to us.&nbsp; Thank you all for your help.
I have ordered food.&nbsp;They will ship on Monday, delivery expected on Wednesday.&nbsp;I have updated the delivery location to my house.&nbsp; Please if the mice\rats are in good condition, leave them for another day.&nbsp;I HF some of the mice left from Wednesday to the baby AMKE.&nbsp;We are very short on mice until this order comes in.
All birds in the freezer have been taken to the crematorium.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When a bird passes or is released: We need to update the case log book with the outcome (D=died, E=Euthanized, R=Released and the date)
We need to update the blue sheet for the bird.&nbsp; This is the sheet that has the finder information on it
The case number and the species need to be added to the white board on the freezer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Multi column

Sandy Grey’s daughter picked a hawk up out of the middle of the road and took it to the Iowa Raptor Project.&nbsp; The bird punctured the daughter’s arm, so they went to a doctor.&nbsp;Iowa Raptor Project staff drove the hawk to clinic but didn’t call first, so no one was there.&nbsp; Then, they eventually took it to Wildthunder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Hawk that hit a window, called back and it had passed away
Sharp-shinned hawk on ground in Iowa city, called back and it had passed away - the finder called Johnson County Conservation because there were also three dead crows within the same area the hawk was so he was concerned about poisoning or avian influenza - he collected their bodies for testing
Baby hawk caught by cat, turned out to be a fledgling robin - there were no injuries so she put it back outside with the parents and is going to keep her cat inside
Possible injured vulture along Mormon Trek, finder had her toddler with her so didn't stop - we went to the location she specified and did not see anything.

Placed on antibiotics and loxicom. A wet to dry bandage and body wrap were applied. There is a quarter size wound over the chest/wing pit area on the left side. The wound was cleaned and debrided. Pretty deep and full of crap.
The missing feathers are on the 2nd digit not the halux. Multi column
Notice This bird is an accipiter not a buteo(Bwha). Very confusing for sure! Reminder on how to tell them apart, Accipiters have a purple oral cavity, have a long 3rd digit with a nub on the underside of the 3rd toe and have a streamlined body. Sharp shinned hawks have a squared off tail, Cohas have a rounded tail tip.&nbsp; Buteos have a robust body, Pink oral cavity, the toes are smaller and probably one of the birds RARE admits frequently.&nbsp; volunteers-

2 calls about songbirds - referred out
1 call about a RTHA in West Liberty. Able to fly, but was perching on fence with one leg, holding up other. It is common for birds to hold one leg up while resting, so unless there were other signs of injury it is probably OK - (Colin) Hasn’t seen in a few hours. Since I live in this area, I told her to text me today/tomorrow and I’ll try to catch it if it’s down. I explained how difficult it would be, since it flies. Otherwise I told her to call RARE and leave a message.

If you’re by yourself and need to give a bird fluids, you can put a smaller amount (less than half) than the amount we would give subcutaneously (under the skin with a needle) into the bird’s mouth or into food or pieces of food being handfed.&nbsp; You can use the same fluids or Pedialyte / Gatorade.
Treatment bird cages should have at least 2 layers of newspaper covering all of the floor of the cage.&nbsp; You can use half sized pieces, but please put them on the bottom underneath the full size sheets, if you can.
All the newspaper from Killy &amp; Bano’s cage doesn’t need to be thrown away every day.&nbsp; Sometimes, I just take off the pieces on top that are dirty and add more clean ones on top of the ones that were already there.

Please do not use the steel brush in the cages. It scratches and rust will form. OK to use on floors though. Try using the drill and gold colored brushes.

One call on a baby bunny in a parking lot-asked if it’s ears were up or pinned back (if they’re up, they’re old enough to be without mom). I advised the caller to leave it be, and maybe move it to a grassy area.

Eagle under a bridge eating fish, possible wing injury, called back and finder said it had flown away.
Injured bat in Illinois close to Clinton border, called back and referred to Echo Guard in DeWitt. I wasn't sure if the finder could transport bats across state lines to Iowa but said Echo may know more about it.
Owl in a chimney in Des Moines, finder had reached out to multiple places including IBR (I was ready to refer him to them) but had yet to hear back. Owl was in reach to grab a few times but kept climbing out of reach. He was more than willing to grab the owl and had everything ready for when he could finally get it. He didn't think it was injured but had the number of rehabbers in case it was.

Follow up on the owl locked in the new addition at Pleasantview in Kalona.&nbsp; I called this morning and was told the owl was still there.&nbsp; I drove down and we searched the entire building and could not locate.&nbsp; The building addition is huge and is in the framing stage with walls but has several cracks around vents and small areas open to the outside. After I got down there they told me they saw it yesterday but hadn’t seen it yet today so I’m assuming it found a way out last night. They will notify us if they see it again.

The food in the fridge was frozen.&nbsp;😣&nbsp;I put the heater back in the cabinet so that we could have thawed food on Saturday.&nbsp; I do want to get the fridge plugged in, hoping that it will keep the food “warmer” than the outside temp.
It's not plugged in at this time, as I didn’t want the heater and the fridge both plugged in at the same time.

The heater that was in the cabinet to thaw the food has been removed due to the potential fire hazard.&nbsp;I bought a refrigerator to be used for thawing the food, this is NOT a garage grade refrigerator, so I’m not sure how well this will work.&nbsp;Garage grade refrigerators only come in a standard size, and are costly.&nbsp;I initially put it in the cabinet, but the door doesn’t open all the way.&nbsp; It is now sitting on the cabinet.&nbsp; We will need to see how this works, I might need to change the direction that the door opens.&nbsp;At this time it is OFF because the freon has to settle, but I put food inside.

Did some tidying up in the office area. Condensed all the stuff that was taped on the wall by the phone to a bulletin board in same spot. Bano’s travel box is in the education cabinet. The stuff on top of the “quarantine” cages is stuff we found that we could possibly put up as interpretive material… will go through it another time. There were 4 boxes of donated newspaper at the door when I arrived.&nbsp; Put it inside the bench by the door (it is like a trunk and the seat opens) as there is not much room for it elsewhere!
If there is anything you cannot find that was originally in the office area, please contact Colin or Elana.

Steve Shillman (319) 330-4450, had a “friend?” crow that fell on ground this spring and he had been feeding it.&nbsp; He said it disappeared the other day and was wondering if someone brought it to us.&nbsp; I’m confused because the last crows we had were AMCR - 22101 was euthanized on 10/3/22 due to neurological issues, &amp; AMCR - 2298 was euthanized on 9/28/22 for a right wing fx.&nbsp; I did not contact him because I wasn’t sure if there was another crow that came in since then, or if he did not get notified or wasn’t listed as a finder on the paperwork.
Alisha Latart (978) 826-0220, called to report a very large bird (maybe a hawk) sitting on the ground in the front yard of a brown house with a red door on the corner of S Iowa &amp; E Short St in Solon at 2 pm.&nbsp; She went back by it at 3 and said it was gone.

Finder of BAEA HBC in Kossuth County, north of Algona. Caller (John) was desperate trying to get ahold of someone to help this BAEA. which he thinks was hit Sunday night and was still there today. He tried everyone he could think of including DNR, conservation, law authorities and even 2 TV stations and no one would help him. I called him and got his voice mail.&nbsp; Left a message to call Kay at SOAR as she is closer and might know someone. After I left message with him I called Kay and she was aware but didn’t have details. I gave her location and caller’s information.&nbsp;Luckily she has a volunteer that is in that direction (Humboldt) and was going to coordinate.&nbsp; Important FYI for future reference is that the vet in Algona will hold birds until SOAR can arrange transport.&nbsp;There are no listed rehabbers in that county or any surrounding counties on any list that I could find.

I think we are on the last charcoal anesthesia filter, and it can only gain 25 more g.
Recycling: ABC Disposal picks up single stream recycling @ the clinic (which means that all the recyclable items can go in the recycling dumpster together).&nbsp; Both dumpsters are red, but the one to put the recycling in is on the south side (farther away from the clinic than the garbage dumpster).&nbsp; Inside the clinic, there are 2 blue bins labeled to put recyclable items into: 1 in the exam area, &amp; 1 in the office area.&nbsp; Please put clean, shiny ads from the usable newspaper into 1 of the recycling bins, &amp; keep it separate from the containers marked as newspaper for cages.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can ask me any questions, but if you're not sure if something can be recycled or don't want to clean plastic/metal containers, just leave it in one of the blue bins, &amp; I'll sort it and take it out.&nbsp; I also put a container of scratch paper by the exam table - please keep it there, so people have paper to write down messages when we answer the phone under the exam table.&nbsp; I gathered the binder clips &amp; clothespins and moved them from the white board area to under the exam table, but I don't care where they are, so they can be moved if someone wants them somewhere else.&nbsp; Thank you all so much!&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can stop reading now unless you want examples of items that can and can’t be recycled: YES - clean, shiny newspaper ads that we don't use in cages; other paper products like computer paper, clean paper bags, envelopes (window envelopes are ok); clean cardboard (without poop); chipboard like boxes that latex gloves come in; plastic bottles like soda, bottled water, &amp; bleach / Dawn dish soap / eye wash containers; pill bottles; aluminum cans (like soda &amp; clean dog food cans); &amp; large plastic syringe containers (small pieces &amp; caps will not be processed correctly by the single stream sorting&nbsp; equipment).&nbsp; Clean, soft plastic bags like grocery bags &amp; plastic shipping air pillows and bubble wrap can't be recycled in the dumpster, but I can take it to a grocery store.
NO - coffee cups &amp; lids (cardboard sleeves are ok), bags that fluids come in, paper with metallic content (like glitter), writing utensils, plastic silverware, glass, wax paper, paper containers with food on them, styrofoam, syringes, paper shipping bags with bubble wrap inside (paper can't be separated from the plastic material), &amp; dirty plastic bags.&nbsp;&nbsp; Multi column

BAOW from Meadow Lane, east of Highway 965 on the southside of the Coralville Res. Did not appear to have any broken bones, but the right eye appears foggy. Delivered to Kim at clinic after completing chores at barn.

Wear face masks
Gown up when handling the birds or wear a shirt that can be washed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Spray gloves lightly with Rocal when finished with a bird.
Mop the floors with bleach each day.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you are at the barn / clinic the same day change shoes, take precautions to avoid potential cross contamination.
At the barn please take care of the educational birds first.
Use disinfectant for the barn cages.
We will NOT be changing our intake protocols; we just need to be cautious.&nbsp; Please place any new admits in the quarantine area.
